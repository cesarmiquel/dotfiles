# README

This repo has my Tmux and NeoVim configuration files.

## TMux Bindings

These are my most used TMux bindings:

- `c-w`: View all panes / windows
- `c-b c-j`: fzf to a pane / window (using `bin/find-pane.sh`)
- `c-b ,`: rename pane
- `c-b z`: Switch between split panes
- `c-b %`: Split pane vertically
- `c-b c`: Create new window

## Vim Bindings

These are my most important neovim bindings:

- `<leader>-p` : fuzzy find files
- `<leader>-b` : fuzzy find buffer
- `bd`: delete current buffer
- `c-s-right arrow` or `bn`: next buffer
- `c-s-left arrow` or `bp`: previous buffer
- `<leader>` is mapped to the space key in my config
